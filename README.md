# gRPC-server
A lightweight gRPC microservice that connects a web shop to an ERP system in real time. It exposes a gRPC endpoint to query live product stock by calling the ERP’s REST API using credentials and endpoints defined in a simple configuration file (stock.properties). Built with Java, Spring Context, and gRPC, it’s fully modular and minimal.
